<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned some really interesting things during this lesson. The first thing that<br>I learned was the different between Git and Github. I was previously unaware<br>of the difference between the two, but I now know that one stores<br>locally, and one stores in the cloud. I also revisited a lot of<br>commands that I recall learning in IT340 two semesters ago.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had a few issues during this assignment, which were mainly in the<br>beginning with the set up. As I went through the slides, I followed<br>along with the practice examples, so I was able to gain a clear<br>understanding of how to add, commit, and push when it was time to<br>do the assignment. I also had to delete my initially created repository because<br>I closed the PR, so I had to redo it by creating a<br>new repository.<br></p><br></td></tr>
